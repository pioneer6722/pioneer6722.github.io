    <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
    <p class="Who">Hello! We are team Pioneer, also know as team 6722. We are a school based robotics program
        that strives to go to states and beyond. We have 6 teams as of the 2024-2025 season and
        this year we had 3 teams qualify for states. We would like to grow that number and that
        is why we have put together this website.
